# RemoteDesktop
This code provides you a way with some optimizations how to capture desktop WITH cursor and send it to a server. Also added an example of remote control like left click and right click (native API you know)


The code will be not updated (except if you have a way to avoid high cpu | ram usage) , you just have to read comments to make more features or to adapt it in a remote access tool !
